# Bellman-Ford-Algorithm
Implementation of the Bellman-Ford Algorithm.


In this problem, we are given a list of currencies 𝑐1, 𝑐2, . . . , 𝑐𝑛 together with a list of exchange rates: 𝑟𝑖𝑗 is the number of units of currency 𝑐𝑗 that one gets for one unit of 𝑐𝑖. We would like to check whether it is possible to start with one unit of some currency, perform a sequence of exchanges, and get more than one unit of the same currency.

We are given an directed graph with possibly negative edge weights and with 𝑛 vertices and 𝑚 edges and we check whether it contains a cycle of negative weight.
